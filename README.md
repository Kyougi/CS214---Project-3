The program is designed to implement a server and a client program. The server contains a tic tac toe game within it meant for the client to interact with. The server and client establish a connection with each other to send and recieve input and output. The server is then able to respond to 4 of the protocols from the client and respond with 5 of its own protocols. 2 players from 2 separate clients are able to connect to the server and play a game of tic tac toe through their client by using certain protocols to make their moves. Once in the game, they can either win, loss, ask for a draw, or resign.

The test plan is made to look at each of the breaking points of the program. The first test plan was to ensure that the client we made for testing could connect to the server.
